About me

Hey! My name is Andrew Alsing. I've been tinkering with computers ever since I was 5. As a kid, I would bond with my Dad through building helping him computers and learning machine language. 
When I got older, I dipped my toes into python2 and made simple clicker games, rpgs, and scripts to help me with every day tasks. Computers and programming is a way for me to express myself and make nearly anything I set my mind on.
One of my favorite things about computers is that the tech industry is moving at a rapid fast-paced rate and encourages life-long learning.
Outside of computers I love to drive cars on track, rockclimb, and cook!
